# qr
"real-time" qr code generator

Type stuff into text box, QR code is generated.

# Dependencies
- phpqrcode 1.1.4 via [https://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpqrcode/files/releases/)

# Todo
- Saw Taco Bell use an image as a qr code (which [linked to their app](qr.tacobell.com/2p7gy-qr) ). Hopefully want to be able to take an image as input and generate the same.
